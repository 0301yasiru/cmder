# Cmder

**Yes, you can [download latest release](https://github.com/bliker/cmder/releases)**

Cmder is a package created out of pure frustration over absence of usable console emulator on Windows. It is based on [ConEmu](https://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/) with *major* config overhaul. Monokai color scheme, amazing [clink](https://code.google.com/p/clink/) and custom prompt layout.

## Why use it

The main advantage of Cmder is portablibity. It is designed to be totally self-container. With no external dependencies. That makes is great for **USB Sticks** or **Dropbox**. So you can carry your console, aliases and binaries (like wget, curl and git) with you anywhere.

## Keyboard shortcuts

### Tab manipulation

* `Ctrl + t` : new tab dialog (maybe you want to open cmd as admin?)
* `Ctrl + w` : close tab
* `Ctrl + alt + number` : fast new tab: `1` - CMD, `2` - Powershell `*` - More to come
* `Alt + enter`: Fullscreen

### Shell

* `Shift + Up` : Traverse up in directory structure (lovely feature!)
* `End, Home, ctrl` : Traversing text with as usual on Windows
* `Ctrl + r` : History search
* `Shift + mouse` : Select and copy text from buffer

(Some shortcuts are not yet documented, thought they exist, please add them here)
